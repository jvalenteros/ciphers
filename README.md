A web application for encoding and decoding text using various ciphers. This project was developed as part of a university course on web development.

## Features

- 🔐 **Multiple Ciphers:** Supports a variety of ciphers including ROT13, Caesar, and Vigenère.
- 🔄 **Bidirectional Operation:** Functionality to both encode and decode text for each supported cipher.
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics:** Displays character and word counts as you type.
- 📋 **Clipboard Integration:** Easily copy the output text with a single click.
- 🎨 **Responsive Design:** A clean and intuitive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- ⚡ **Efficient State Management:** Utilizes React's state management for a fast and responsive user experience.

## Supported Ciphers

- ROT13
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher
- More to be added soon.

## How to Use

1.  **Select a Cipher:** Choose the desired cipher from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Enter Text:** Type or paste the text you want to encode or decode into the input field.
3.  **Provide a Key:** For ciphers that require a key (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère), enter the key in the designated field.
4.  **Process Text:** Click the "Encode" or "Decode" button.
5.  **View Output:** The result will be displayed in the output field.
6.  **Copy or Clear:** Use the "Copy" button to copy the result to your clipboard, or "Clear" to reset the fields.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Installation and Usage

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jvalenteros/ciphers.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ciphers
    ```
3.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
-   **Language:** JavaScript

## Future Work

-   Implement additional ciphers.
-   Custom cipher algorithms using node links (WIP)
-   Add functionality to analyze the strength of the encoded text.
-   Write unit tests for the cipher functions.
